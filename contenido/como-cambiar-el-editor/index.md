Bludit by default uses SimpleMDE Editor - a simple and clean editor for Markdown code but you can also choose TinyMCE which supports HTML Code and is more friendly. SimpleMDE and TinyMCE are pre-installed on Bludit by default, both are plugins and you can find it in the plugin section.

## How to change to TinyMCE
- Log in into the **Admin panel**.
- Go to **Plugins** on the left menu.
- Find the plugin **SimpleMDE** and click on the button **Deactivate**.
- Find the plugin **TinyMCE** and click on the button **Activate**.
- Now you have enabled TinyMCE as editor.
